I remember a time,A Change Of Seasons
"My frail, virgin mind",A Change Of Seasons
Watched the crimson sunrise,A Change Of Seasons
Imagined what it might find,A Change Of Seasons
Life was filled with wonder,A Change Of Seasons
I felt the warm wind blow,A Change Of Seasons
I must explore the boundaries,A Change Of Seasons
Transcend the depth of winter's snow,A Change Of Seasons
Innocence caressing me,A Change Of Seasons
I never felt so young before,A Change Of Seasons
There was so much life in me,A Change Of Seasons
Still I longed to search for more,A Change Of Seasons
But those days are gone now,A Change Of Seasons
Changed like a leaf on a tree,A Change Of Seasons
Blown away forever,A Change Of Seasons
Into the cool autumn breeze,A Change Of Seasons
The snow has now fallen,A Change Of Seasons
And my sun's not so bright,A Change Of Seasons
I struggle to hold on,A Change Of Seasons
With the last of my might,A Change Of Seasons
In my den of inequity,A Change Of Seasons
Viciousness and subtlety,A Change Of Seasons
Struggle to ease the pain,A Change Of Seasons
Struggle to find the same,A Change Of Seasons
Ignorance surrounding me,A Change Of Seasons
I've never been so filled with fear,A Change Of Seasons
All my life's been drained from me,A Change Of Seasons
The end is drawing near...,A Change Of Seasons
"""Carpe diem",A Change Of Seasons
"Seize the day""",A Change Of Seasons
I'll always remember,A Change Of Seasons
The chill of November,A Change Of Seasons
"The news of the fall, the sounds in the hall",A Change Of Seasons
The clock on the wall ticking away,A Change Of Seasons

We can learn from the past,A Change Of Seasons
But those days are gone,A Change Of Seasons
We can hope for the future,A Change Of Seasons
But there may not be one,A Change Of Seasons
The words stuck in my mind,A Change Of Seasons
Alive from what I've learned,A Change Of Seasons
I have to seize the day,A Change Of Seasons
To home I returned,A Change Of Seasons
Preparing for her flight,A Change Of Seasons
I held with all my might,A Change Of Seasons
Fearing my deepest fright,A Change Of Seasons
She walked into the night,A Change Of Seasons
She turned for one last look,A Change Of Seasons
She looked me in the eye,A Change Of Seasons

So far or so it seems,A Change Of Seasons
All is lost with nothing fulfilled,A Change Of Seasons
Off the pages and the T.V. screen,A Change Of Seasons
Another world where nothing's true,A Change Of Seasons
Tripping through the life fantastic,A Change Of Seasons
Lose a step and never get up,A Change Of Seasons
Left alone with a cold blank stare,A Change Of Seasons
I feel like giving up,A Change Of Seasons
I was blinded by a paradise,A Change Of Seasons
Utopia high in the sky,A Change Of Seasons
A dream that only drowned me,A Change Of Seasons
"Deep in sorrow, wondering why",A Change Of Seasons
Oh come let us adore him,A Change Of Seasons
Abuse and then ignore him,A Change Of Seasons
"No matter what, don't let him be",A Change Of Seasons
Let's feed upon his misery,A Change Of Seasons
Then string him up for all the world to see,A Change Of Seasons
I'm sick of all you hypocrites holding me at bay,A Change Of Seasons
And I don't need your sympathy to get me through the day,A Change Of Seasons
Seasons change and so can I,A Change Of Seasons

To deal with me,A Change Of Seasons
I'm much wiser now,A Change Of Seasons
A lifetime of memories run through my head,A Change Of Seasons
They taught me how,A Change Of Seasons
For better or worse,A Change Of Seasons

III. The Issue of Jury Nullification,United States v. Dougherty
"Our reference to the ""intensity"" factor underlying the pro se right should not be understood as embracing the principle of ""nullification"" proffered by appellants. They say that the jury has a well-recognized prerogative to disregard the instructions of the court even as to matters of law, and that they accordingly have the legal right that the jury be informed of its power. We turn to this matter in order to define the nature of the new trial permitted by our mandate.",United States v. Dougherty
"There has evolved in the Anglo-American system an undoubted jury prerogative-in-fact, derived from its power to bring in a general verdict of not guilty in a criminal case, that is not reversible by the court. The power of the courts to punish jurors for corrupt or incorrect verdicts, which persisted after the medieval system of attaint by another jury became obsolete, was repudiated in 1670 when Bushell's Case, 124 Eng.Rep. 1006 (C.P. 1670) discharged the jurors who had acquitted William Penn of unlawful assembly. Juries in civil cases became subject to the control of ordering a new trial; no comparable control evolved for acquittals in criminal cases.",United States v. Dougherty
"Since the jury's prerogative of lenity, again in Learned Hand's words (supra, note 34) introduces a ""slack into the enforcement of law, tempering its rigor by the mollifying influence of current ethical conventions,"" it is only just, say appellants, that the jurors be so told. It is unjust to withhold information on the jury power of ""nullification,"" since conscientious jurors may come, ironically, to abide by their oath as jurors to render verdicts offensive to their individual conscience, to defer to an assumption of necessity that is contrary to reality.",United States v. Dougherty
"This so-called right of jury nullification is put forward in the name of liberty and democracy, but its explicit avowal risks the ultimate logic of anarchy. This is the concern voiced by Judge Sobeloff in United States v. Moy-lan, 417 F.2d 1002, 1009 (4th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 910, 90 S.Ct. 908, 25 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970):",United States v. Dougherty
"To encourage individuals to make their own determinations as to which laws they will obey and which they will permit themselves as a matter of conscience to disobey is to invite chaos. No legal system could long survive if it gave every individual the option of disregarding with impunity any law which by his personal standard was judged morally untenable. Toleration of such conduct would not be democratic, as appellants claim, but inevitably anarchic.The statement that avowal of the jury's prerogative runs the risk of anarchy, represents, in all likelihood, the habit of thought of philosophy and logic, rather than the prediction of the social scientist. But if the statement contains an element of hyperbole, the existence of risk and danger, of significant magnitude, cannot be gainsaid. In contrast, the advocates of jury ""nullification"" apparently assume that the articulation of the jury's power will not extend its use or extent, or will not do so significantly or obnoxiously. Can this assumption fairly be made? We know that a posted limit of 60 m.p.h. produces factual speeds 10 or even 15 miles greater, with an understanding all around that some ""tolerance"" is acceptable to the authorities, assuming conditions warrant. But can it be supposed that the speeds would stay substantially the same if the speed limit were put: Drive as fast as you think appropriate, without the posted limit as an anchor, a point of departure?",United States v. Dougherty
"Our jury system is a resultant of many vectors, some explicit, and some rooted in tradition, continuity and general understanding without express formulation. A constitution may be meaningful though it is unwritten, as the British have proved for 900 years.",United States v. Dougherty
"Rules of law or justice involve choice of values and ordering of objectives for which unanimity is unlikely in any society, or group representing the society, especially a society as diverse in cultures and interests as ours. To seek unity out of diversity, under the national motto, there must be a procedure for decision by vote of a majority or prescribed plurality — in accordance with democratic philosophy. To assign the role of mini-legislature to the various petit juries, who must hang if not unanimous, exposes criminal law and administration to paralysis, and to a deadlock that betrays rather than furthers the assumptions of viable democracy.",United States v. Dougherty
"Moreover, to compel a juror involuntarily assigned to jury duty to assume the burdens of mini-legislator or judge, as is implicit in the doctrine of nullification, is to put untoward strains on the jury system. It is one thing for a juror to know that the law condemns, but he has a factual power of lenity. To tell him expressly of a nullification prerogative, however, is to inform him, in effect, that it is he who fashions the rule that condemns. That is an overwhelming responsibility, an extreme burden for the jurors' psyche. And it is not inappropriate to add that a juror called upon for an involuntary public service is entitled to the protection, when he takes action that he knows is right, but also knows is unpopular, either in the community at large or in his own particular grouping, that he can fairly put it to friends and neighbors that he was merely following the instructions of the court.",United States v. Dougherty
"In the last analysis, our rejection of the request for jury nullification doctrine is a recognition that here are times when logic is not the only or even best guide to sound conduct of government. For machines, one can indulge the person who likes to tinker in pursuit of fine tuning. When men and judicial machinery are involved, one must attend to the many and complex mechanisms and reasons that lead men to change their conduct — when they know they are being studied; when they are told of the consequences of their conduct; and when conduct exercised with restraint as an unwritten exception is expressly presented as a legitimate option.",United States v. Dougherty
"Finally, we are aware that the denial of defendants' request for a nullification instruction will be considered by them to negative some, or perhaps most, of the value of the right of pro se representation which we have recognized. This point could be answered in terms of logic: The right of self-representation is given for reasons recognized by the law, and cannot be a springboard to establish the validity of other advantages or conditions that lie in its tactical wake. Thus, a defendant's ability to present his demeanor and often even a kind of testimony, without exposure to impeachment or cross-examination, may be a tactical consequence of pro se representation, and even a moving cause of its invocation, but this is not to say it is an objective of the law. But defendants' position merits a more spacious answer, that lies outside the domain of formal logic. It is this. The jury system provides flexibility for the consideration of interests of justice outside the formal rules of law. This embraces whatever extra the defendant conveys by personal representation, whether through demeanor or sincerity of justification. But it is subject to the overriding consideration that what is tolerable or even desirable as an informal, self-initiated exception, harbors grave dangers to the system if it is opened to expansion and intensification through incorporation in the judge's instruction.",United States v. Dougherty
IV. The Jury Instructions,United States v. Dougherty
* * *,United States v. Dougherty
"The judgment must be reversed, for the reasons stated in part II of this opinion, and the case remanded for new trial, if the Government be so advised, in accordance with parts III and IV.",United States v. Dougherty
So ordered.,United States v. Dougherty
"BAZELON, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:I concur in the Court's discussion of the statutory right of self-representation in criminal cases. In view of our holding that the statutory right is ""unqualified,"" our decision need not rest on the asserted constitutional right to proceed pro se. I emphasize, however, that my concurrence reflects no retreat from the position I expressed thirteen years ago in Brown v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 84, 264 F.2d 363, 370 (1959) (en banc) (dissenting opinion). I believed then, and I believe today, that the sixth amendment guarantees a defendant the right to act on his own behalf in resisting a criminal prosecution.",United States v. Dougherty
"The sticking point, however, is whether or not the jury should be told of its power to nullify the law in a particular case. Here, the trial judge not only denied a requested instruction on nullification, but also barred defense counsel from raising the issue in argument before the jury. The majority affirms that ruling. I see no justification for, and considerable harm in, this deliberate lack of candor.",United States v. Dougherty
"At trial, the defendants made no effort to deny that they had committed the acts charged. Their defense was designed to persuade the jury that it would be unconscionable to convict them of violating a statute whose general validity and applicability they did not challenge. An instruction on nullification — or at least some argument to the jury on that issue — was, therefore, the linchpin of the defense.",United States v. Dougherty
"Thus, we are left with a doctrine that may ""enhance the over-all normative effect of the rule of law,"" but, at the same time, one that must not only be concealed from the jury, but also effectively condemned in the jury's presence. Plainly, the justification for this sleight-of-hand lies in a fear that an occasionally noble doctrine will, if acknowledged, often be put to ignoble and abusive purposes — or, to borrow the Court's phrase, will ""run the risk of anarchy."" Majority opinion at 1134. A breakdown of the legal order is not a result I would knowingly encourage or enjoy. But the question cannot be resolved, at least at this stage of the argument, by asking if we are for or against anarchy, or if we are willing to tolerate a little less law and order so that we can permit a little more jury nullification. No matter how horrible the effect feared by the Court, the validity of its reasoning depends on the existence of a demonstrable connection between the alleged cause (a jury nullification instruction or argument to the jury on that issue) and that effect. I am unable to see a connection.",United States v. Dougherty
"To be sure, there are abusive purposes, discussed below, to which the doctrine might be put. The Court assumes that these abuses are most likely to occur if the doctrine is formally described to the jury by argument or instruction. That assumption, it should be clear, does not rest on any proposition of logic. It is nothing more or less than a prediction of how jurors will react to the judge's instruction or argument by counsel. And since we have no empirical data to measure the validity of the prediction, we must rely on our own rough judgments of its plausibility.",United States v. Dougherty
"It seems substantially more plausible to me to assume that the very opposite is true. The juror motivated by prejudice seems to me more likely to make spontaneous use of the power to nullify, and more likely to disregard the judge's exposition of the normally controlling legal standards. The conscientious juror, who could make a careful effort to consider the blameworthiness of the defendant's action in light of prevailing community values, is the one most likely to obey the judge's admonition that the jury enforce strict principles of law.",United States v. Dougherty
"My own view rests on the premise that nullification can and should serve an important function in the criminal process. I do not see it as a doctrine that exists only because we lack the power to punish jurors who refuse to enforce the law or to re-prosecute a defendant whose acquittal cannot be justified in the strict terms of law. The doctrine permits the jury to bring to bear on the criminal process a sense of fairness and particularized justice. The drafters of legal rules cannot anticipate and take account of every case where a defendant's conduct is ""unlawful"" but not blameworthy, any more than they can draw a bold line to mark the boundary between an accident and negligence. It is the jury — as spokesman for the community's sense of values — that must explore that subtle and elusive boundary.",United States v. Dougherty
"I do not see any reason to assume that jurors will make rampantly abusive use of their power. Trust in the jury is, after all, one of the cornerstones of our entire criminal jurisprudence, and if that trust is without foundation we must re-examine a great deal more than just the nullification doctrine. Nevertheless, some abuse can be anticipated. If a jury refuses to apply strictly the controlling principles of law, it may — in conflict with values shared by the larger community — convict a defendant because of prejudice against him, or acquit a defendant because of sympathy for him and prejudice against his victim. Our fear of unjust conviction is plainly understandable. But it is hard for me to see how a nullification instruction could enhance the likelihood of that result. The instruction would speak in terms of acquittal, not conviction, and it would provide no comfort to a juror determined to convict a defendant in defiance of the law or the facts of the case. Indeed, unless the jurors ignored the nullification instruction they could not convict on the grounds of prejudice alone. Does the judge's recitation of the instruction increase the likelihood that the jury will ignore the limitation that lies at its heart? I hardly think so.",United States v. Dougherty
"ADAMS, Circuit Judge:This case presents several difficult and subtle issues. Their resolution requires a sensitive understanding of human dignity, American legal and political history, and the interrelationship of those factors with the present criminal justice system, for it is this system that ensures that all persons may peacefully pursue their interests without undue interference from others.",United States v. Dougherty
"Here, the defendants, by interrupting the business of a large chemical company, attempted to publicize their dissenting views regarding the morality of the American involvement in the Vietnam War. It is apparent that the defendants attempted to exploit their criminal trial by using it as a platform for further exposition of their beliefs, and to rely on their moral position as a defense of criminal charges lodged against them. In furtherance of their efforts to transform what would otherwise be an ordinary criminal trial into a ""political"" fray, defendants wished to represent themselves, to deviate from the usual mode of conducting a criminal trial, and to argue to the jury that although they were in violation of the applicable statutes, they should be acquitted because their actions were morally justified.",United States v. Dougherty
"The rulings of the district court regarding (a) the defendants' motions to proceed pro se, (b) the defendants' right to have the court charge the jury as to the nullification issue, and (c) the content of the charge as actually given provide the foundation of this appeal.",United States v. Dougherty
"In addressing these questions, some of which are to a large extent as philosophical as they are legal, the Court of Appeals is at some disadvantage — especially with regard to self representation — in evaluating the district court's action from the cold record, divorced from the climate of the time when the trial took place. We must be mindful that the events in question here — defendants' criminal acts as well as the trial itself — occurred during a period of passionate and at times bitter political dissent. Several so-called ""political"" trials, including those of Dr. Benjamin Spock, the Catonsville Nine, and the Chicago Seven, occurred prior to this proceeding. In particular, it is significant that this trial closely followed that of the Chicago Seven, a trial wracked with violent disruptions when the defendants there challenged the underlying structure of the criminal justice system as we know it today.",United States v. Dougherty
"In the context of what was transpiring in the judicial process in 1968 and 1969, the trial judge here was faced with a formidable task. On one hand, he had to preserve the judicial atmosphere vital in criminal proceedings to assure that both the Government and the defendants received a fair trial on the merits. The judge could not help but be aware that as a society we believe that an orderly, adversary trial by jury is a most efficacious means of arriving at the truth of the matters into which the court is inquiring. On the other hand, he had to take account of the asserted rights of the defendants to present themselves as moral persons — possessed with dignity and freedom of spirit, attributes upon which our system of Government was founded and built — as they sought to be acquitted of their crimes. In evaluating whether the trial judge erred, we must be cognizant of the delicate balance he had to strike between ordered tranquility and America's irrepressible desire for liberty. Only if the court unduly weighted the scales against the defendants, either by his application of the facts of this case to the rules governing his actions or by his interpretation of the controlling law, may we reverse the convictions.",United States v. Dougherty
"Since I would not reverse these convictions based on violation of defendants' right to self-representation, I need not express an opinion on the issues of jury nullification and the charge to the jury. With regard to these latter questions, Judge Leventhal's statement of the law is wholly acceptable.",United States v. Dougherty
"A careful review of the transcript of the proceedings with respect to defendants' motions to dispense with counsel indicates that the defendants on many occasions interrupted the proceeding for various reasons, despite the fact they were represented by counsel at that time. The printed record cannot inform us whether such interruptions were violent, impolite, contemptuous, or made with an impertinent or sarcastic tone of voice. However more than once the judge had to threaten intervention by the marshals to impress upon defendants that they had to obey orders of the court to be seated. At other times, the language used by the defendants appeared to be disrespectful or even rude. That the trial judge appeared to tolerate many instances of this type of behavior, and even engaged in discourse with defendants, does not prove that he acquiesced in such extraordinary tactics, but rather indicates that he was attempting to preserve some sort of order.",United States v. Dougherty
"Although it may be argued that there are some things in the judicial process more important than decorum in a courtroom, we are not faced with such perplexing alternatives here. Dissent is a healthy manifestation of the freedoms we as a nation profess and cherish. And a criminal trial might serve as the seed around which a point of view may crystallize. But a courtroom is not an arena in which dissention, particularly of a disruptive nature, may supplant, or even take precedence over, the task of administering justice.",United States v. Dougherty
"As mentioned earlier, it is not without significance that this trial occurred at a time when the judicial system was being subjected to great stress because of the actions of some defendants and attorneys. The trial judge was surely aware of the publicity that attended the commission of the charged crimes, and the notoriety the trial itself would achieve. To paraphrase a slogan of the ""new left"", he did not have to be a weatherman to tell which way the wind was blowing.",United States v. Dougherty
"Certainly, what transpired here, coupled with the real threat of further disruption, was sufficient to alert the trial judge to what could be expected if the motions to dispense with counsel were granted. Thus, his determination that to grant the motions would turn the trial into a shambles does not appear to be unreasonable.",United States v. Dougherty
"Accordingly, I would conclude that defendants had, by their conduct, waived their right to proceed pro se, and would affirm the rulings by the district court that the defendants in these circumstances had to be represented by counsel. Based on this and on Judge Leventhal's opinion with regard to nullification and the charge, I would affirm the judgments of convictions.",United States v. Dougherty
On Appellee's Petition for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc,United States v. Dougherty
"LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge:The Government's petition for rehearing leads us to amplify our opinion.",United States v. Dougherty
"The Government argues that defendant's right to defend himself at trial is not absolute, and cites the Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge (ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, § 6.6, Tentative Draft, June 1972, at 85), which states in pertinent commentary:Moreover, the interest of the public in an orderly, rational trial is entitled to consideration in determining the defendant's right to appear pro se. See United States v. Bentvena, 319 F.2d 916, 937 (2d Cir. 1963); Butler v. United States, 317 F.2d 249, 258 (8th Cir. 1963).",United States v. Dougherty
"We agree with this statement to the extent set forth in our opinion, including e. g., that a defendant's disruption may waive his right to pro se representation. We note that both Butler, cited in our opinion (at fn. 14), and Bentvena, are cases involving requests for pro se representation made after the commencement of trial — a situation that, as our opinion points out, is entirely different from that of a pro se claim made timely before trial begins. Indeed in Bentvena the court stated, 319 F.2d at 938:One charged with crime has an absolute right to do without an attorney and conduct his own defense (28 U.S.C. § 1654), but that is quite different from the right to discharge counsel after trial has begun. This latter right is a qualified one.",United States v. Dougherty
"The petition for rehearing submits:With particular regard to the value of an orderly trial, we believe that a trial judge should have authority to engraft reasonable conditions on the exercise of a defendant's right of self-representation.",United States v. Dougherty
"It suffices to say that this case did not present a situation where the trial judge sought to prescribe reasonable conditions to accompany pro se representation. We do not have before us whether, or in what manner, a trial judge could prescribe conditions for the purpose of assuring a trial without disruption — to carry out the implied premise that there will be reasonable cooperation from the defendants, as opposed to any manipulation of the trial process so as to interfere with fair administration of justice.",United States v. Dougherty
"The Government stresses a contention that the court's opinion improperly bypasses the doctrine of harmless error. Apart from the matters set forth in the opinion already filed, we observe that if the conventional doctrine of harmless error is applied, it will in effect undercut the right of pro se representation, since rarely if ever can there be a showing of prejudice in terms of result from the conduct of a trial by counsel. There is no requirement of a showing of prejudice when counsel has been denied. A like rule is applicable, although for different reasons, when pro se representation is denied.",United States v. Dougherty

Footnotes:,United States v. Dougherty
"The defendants are charged in Count One, with burglary in the second degree. And in Counts Two and Three, with destroying private property. These charges are serious. The accumulative possible punishment which could be imposed on each of these defendants could total as much as 35 years imprisonment, and also, a fine.",United States v. Dougherty
"This Court conducted an examination of the moving defendants. There is no doubt that they are well educated people, and as far as the Court is concerned, there is no question about the matter of their motivation.",United States v. Dougherty
"However, they have indicated that none of them have ever studied common law, and they indicated their unfamiliarity with the essential rules of evidence and procedure.",United States v. Dougherty
"Although it is expected that they will desire to consult with counsel before and during trial, this Court is under the opinion that such consultation would be inadequate under the circumstances in this case.",United States v. Dougherty
"A large number of defendants are involved here. Examination, cross-examination and objections made by five persons, totally unfamiliar with the rules of evidence and procedure, might not only disrupt the proceedings, it might also prejudice the jury and jeopardize the rights of their co-defendants.",United States v. Dougherty

"The bill was drafted and enacted at a time when there was a ""current state of incertitude regarding the probability of constitutional amendment."" J. Goebel, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, p. 490, vol. 1, History of the Supreme Court (Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise, Macmillan Co. 1971).",United States v. Dougherty
"It was held binding on the states in United States ex rel Maldonado v. Denno, 348 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1965). See also Manson v. Pitchess, 317 F.Supp. 816 (C.D.Calif.1970). We need express no opinion on this point.",United States v. Dougherty
"The Supreme Court has indicated though not held that an accused may be competent to stand trial and yet be incompetent to waive his right to counsel. Westbrook v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 150, 86 S.Ct. 1320, 16 L.Ed.2d 429 (1966). The Ninth Circuit apparently does not even recognize that limitation of the pro se right, see United States v. Odom, 423 F.2d 875 (9th Cir. 1970). Such a limitation, if it exists, suggests that there is a point of incompetency, short of complete incapacity, where a defendant is able to understand the nature of the charges against him and to assist in the preparation of his defense, yet does not have the capacity to waive counsel and undertake representation of himself.",United States v. Dougherty
"Obviously, appellants intelligently waived their right to counsel.",United States v. Dougherty

"At an 1800 trial Thomas Cooper, pro se, was not permitted to subpoena the President, but he ""was given great latitude in what he was permitted to offer in his defense."" Thus Justice Chase issued subpoenas at the defendant's request to members of Congress. Goebel, supra, p. 640.",United States v. Dougherty
"The Lee decision states that a defendant is not entitled to ""hybrid"" representation in open court — both pro se and by counsel. See generally Annotation, 77 A.L.R.2d 1233 (1961). But see Bayless v. United States, supra.",United States v. Dougherty
§ 6.7. Standby counsel for defendant representing himself.,United States v. Dougherty
"When a defendant has been permitted to proceed without the assistance of counsel, the trial judge should consider the appointment of standby counsel to assist the defendant when called upon and to call the judge's attention to matters favorable to the accused upon which the judge should rule on his own motion. Standby counsel should always be appointed in cases expected to be long or complicated or in which there are multiple defendants.",United States v. Dougherty
"Accord, United States v. Spencer, supra note 17, 439 F.2d at 1051.",United States v. Dougherty

"The study supports in depth the conclusion that the jury is likely to call on its prerogative of lenity and equity, contrary to the judge's instruction, when the case is one where it can empathize with the defendant, feeling either that the jurors might well have been or come to be in the same position, or that in the large the defendant's conduct is not so contrary to general conduct standards as to be condemned as criminally deviate conduct. From a study teeming with illustrations, the following are cited as examples.",United States v. Dougherty
"The authors broadly discern that ""in cases having a de minimis cast or a note of contributory fault or provocation * * * the jury will exercise its de facto powers to write these equities into the criminal law"" (p. 285) and ""an impatience with the nicety of the law's boundaries hedging the privilege of self-defense"" (p. 241). (E. g., acquittal for retaliation following assaults, or even harassment and provocation, without present danger; for violence erupting after domestic strife, or unfaithfulness of spouse; for fraud of a victim still the seller's friend; for statutory rape of a girl unchaste; for sale of liquor to a minor who is a member of the armed forces).",United States v. Dougherty
"Perhaps most relevant is ch. 19 on Unpopular Laws, p. 286 et seq. Though the authors discerned no law prompting a jury revolt comparable to the historic acquittals on charges of violation of seditious libel or fugitive slave laws, or even Prohibition, the data indicate that the historic role of the jury as a bulwark against official tyranny is ""dimly evident in its contemporary role as a moderate corrective against undue prosecutions for gambling, game and liquor violations and, to some extent, drunken driving"" (p. 296), the jury's traditional hostility to sumptuary legislation being ""keyed to its perception that . . . widespread violation is tolerated"" so that prosecution of a particular defendant is contrary to the principle of evenhanded justice (p. 287). And so in some counties ""people generally do not like the game law"" (p. 288). In counties where jurors play the numbers they acquit broadly in gambling cases (p. 289) etc. When the jurors ""feel the same thing could happen to them,"" they will acquit even of negligent manslaughter charges, as in running a red light, though there are more convictions in cases involving extreme speed. (Ch. 24).",United States v. Dougherty
"Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred the common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge, he was to have it. Beyond this, the jury trial provisions in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power — a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. Fear of unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal Governments in other respects, found expression in the criminal law in this insistence upon community participation in the determination of guilt or innocence.",United States v. Dougherty
"Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 1906, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970):",United States v. Dougherty
"The institution of trial by jury — especially in criminal cases — has its hold upon public favor chiefly for two reasons. The individual can forfeit his liberty — to say nothing of his life — only at the hands of those who, unlike any official, are in no wise accountable, directly or indirectly, for what they do, and who at once separate and melt anonymously in the community from which they came. Moreover, since if they acquit their verdict is final, no one is likely to suffer of whose conduct they do not morally disapprove; and this introduces a slack into the enforcement of law, tempering its rigor by the mollifying influence of current ethical conventions.",United States v. Dougherty
"The articles of impeachment of Justice Chase included charges that he had failed to instruct juries on their power to disregard the judge's instructions. His vigorous defense of his course was in terms like those later developed by Justice Story in United States v. Battiste, see infra. On this, as on other articles, the radical Republicans were defeated. Evans, Report of the Trial of the Hon. Samuel Chase.",United States v. Dougherty
"In Maryland the juries must be told the judge's instructions on the law are only ""advisory"". In Indiana, a similar constitutional provision was attenuated by a decision that a trial court in a criminal case ""is not required to neutralize the effect of its instructions by telling the jury that they are at liberty to disregard them, and to decide the law for themselves."" Bridgewater v. State, 153 Ind. 560, 566, 55 N.E. 737, 739 (1889).",United States v. Dougherty
"The clash of departments or even of officials, so characteristic of our polity, the extreme decentralization that allows a local jury or even a local prosecutor to hold up instead of uphold the law of the state, the elaborate machinery of check, balance and subdivision which the Puritan jealousy of the magistrate has fixed in our institutions, too often result in a legal paralysis of legal administration.",United States v. Dougherty
"But jurors sufficiently beset by the strain respond on their own to a call of higher conscience they believe strong and clear. Indeed in 1830 the bankers of England formally petitioned the Commons to abolish capital punishment for forgery because this prevented convictions ""and thus endangers the property which it is intended to protect."" Radzinowicz, op. cit. supra, Appendix 3, p. 730. (The Petition of Bankers from 214 Cities and Towns, May 24, 1830)",United States v. Dougherty
"Blackstone refers to the ""pious perjury"" under which jurors understated the value of articles stolen in order to avoid the capital charge. 4 Comm. 239. Professor Radzinowicz (op. cit. supra, at ch. 3, and 4) develops this and other lenity practices of grand and petit juries in the 18th and 19th centuries, and even includes (p. 94, fn. 49) an instance wherein Lord Mansfield — a strict judge — advised a jury to find a gold trinket of less value than 40 shillings. When the prosecutor indignantly exclaimed that its fashion alone was worth double that, Lord Mansfield observed, ""God forbid, gentlemen, we should hang a man for fashion's sake.""",United States v. Dougherty

And he went on further to say in that case:,United States v. Dougherty
"We also reaffirm the repeated decisions of this Court that there is no place for violence in a democratic society dedicated to liberty under law, and that the right of peaceful protest does not mean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may do so at any time and at any place. There is a proper time and place for even the most peaceful protest and a plain duty and responsibility on the part of all citizens to obey all valid laws and regulations.",United States v. Dougherty
"If you find that the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the defendants committed each of the elements comprising the crimes of second degree burglary and/or malicious destruction of property, then I must instruct you further that the law does not recognize as a defense to either of these charges that the defendants were motivated to commit their acts by sincere political, religious or moral convictions or in obedience to some higher law.",United States v. Dougherty
"Individuals who believe that the Vietnam War is illegal or immoral or that certain activities of the Dow Company are undesirable have the right under our system of government to express their views or to protest these events by any lawful means, such as by peaceful picketing or parading. But the Constitution of the United States does not protect as a form of symbolic speech the destruction of private property and the violation of valid laws designed to protect society.",United States v. Dougherty
"The defendants may have been motivated by the highest moral principles, and they may have been sincerely and passionately inspired. But such motives do not confer immunity from prosecution or conviction for the violation of a valid law, and as such the motives of the defendants are not controlling in the case which is before you for decision.",United States v. Dougherty
"Therefore, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the defendants had the required intent to commit one or more of the offenses with which they are charged, then it is no defense that he or she also had one or more other intentions, reasons, purposes or motives, such as to protest against the Vietnam War or the activities of the Dow Company; nor is it a defense that he or she acted from sincere, religious motives, or that he or she believed that his or her intent was justified by some higher law.

In Duncan the Supreme Court stated:,United States v. Dougherty
"A right to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the Government.

The nullification doctrine derives from the same moral principles as the mens rea or responsibility defense. But in view of my conclusion that the trial judge should have granted a nullification instruction. it is unnecessary for me to decide whether reversal would be required on the theory that the instruction that was offered effectively directed the jury to make a finding that the defendant possessed the necessary mens rea.

"In another case, it may be important to distinguish the source of the right to proceed pro se. If that right is Constitutional in origin, as held in United States v. Plattner, 330 F.2d 271 (2d Cir. 1964), then any violation of that right at all might require a remand for new trial, despite the absence of prejudice. See id., at 273, and the cases cited in footnote 2 therein. On the other hand, if the right is statutory only, then it may be subject to the harmless error doctrine. Similarly, if the right here asserted is enshrined in the Constitution, rather than established by statute, then a much more serious question regarding waiver would be presented.",United States v. Dougherty
"However, these questions need not be decided in this case because the record here clearly establishes a waiver of the right to proceed pro se, even if such right is deemed Constitutional in nature.",United States v. Dougherty
"* * * But our courts, palladiums of liberty as they are, cannot be treated disrespectfully with impunity. Nor can the accused be permitted by his disruptive conduct indefinitely to avoid being tried on the charges brought against him. It would degrade our country and our judicial system to permit our courts to be bullied, insulted, and humiliated and their orderly progress thwarted and obstructed by defendants brought before them charged with crimes. As guardians of the public welfare, our state and federal judicial systems strive to administer equal justice to the rich and the poor, the good and the bad, the native and foreign born of every race, nationality, and religion. Being manned by humans, the courts are not perfect and are bound to make some errors. But, if our courts are to remain what the Founders intended, the citadels of justice, their proceedings cannot and must not be infected with the sort of scurrilous, abusive language and conduct paraded before the Illinois trial judge in this case."" 397 U.S. at 346-347, 90 S.Ct. at 1062.Justice Brennan, recognizing the importance of orderly trials, also set forth his views in a concurring opinion:",United States v.
